Changelog

2006-06-02:
- initial release of version 0.1

2006-06-05:
- changed behaviour of PostgreSQL function to return NULL in case of
  invalid input, rather than raising an exceptional condition
- improved efficiency of PostgreSQL function (no transformation to C string
  is done)

2006-06-20:
- added -fpic compiler flag in Makefile
- fixed bug in the C code for the ruby library (usage of non-existent
  function)

Release of version 0.2

2006-07-18:
- changed normalization from NFC to NFKC for postgresql unifold function

2006-08-04:
- added support to mark the beginning of a grapheme cluster with 0xFF
  (option: CHARBOUND)
- added the ruby method String#chars, which is returning an array of UTF-8
  encoded grapheme clusters
- added NLF2LF transformation in postgresql unifold function
- added the DECOMPOSE option, if you neither use COMPOSE or DECOMPOSE, no
  normalization will be performed (different from previous versions)
- using integer constants rather than C-strings for character properties
- fixed (hopefully) a problem with the ruby library on Mac OS X, which
  occured when compiler optimization was switched on

2006-09-17:
- added the LUMP option, which lumps certain characters together
  (see lump.txt) (also used for the PostgreSQL "unifold" function)

  (or marks of composed characters)

Release of version 1.0.2

  empty string at grapheme cluster boundaries (method String#utf8chars).

Release of version 1.0.3

2007-06-25:

- Changed license from BSD to MIT style.
- Added a new function 'utf8proc_codepoint_valid' to the C library.

  being treated incorrectly, when stripping default ignorable characters or
  calculating grapheme cluster boundaries.
